    question: 'SHIPPING & PACKAGING INFORMATION',
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>Hackshop engagement is to get your orders to you as quickly as possible in perfect condition. All packages are insured to 100% of the value, and Hackshop Delivery Protection can be used to ensure immediate re-shipment if a package is lost or damaged.</p>
        <p>All orders are securely packaged. Orders are further protected in an untearable polyurethane satchel, ensuring that your package is not tampered with during delivery.</p>
        <p>To ensure privacy and reduce theft, all packages are anonymous - there is no mention of product contents or Hackshop branding on the outside of the packaging.</p>
      </>

  {
    question: 'Shipping Options',
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>Hackshop provides three types of shipping options:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
          <li>Standard Shipping Delivery [deliveryTime: 5-7 days]</li>
          <li>Express Shipping Delivery [deliveryTime: 2-3 days]</li>
          <li>Overnight Shipping Delivery [deliveryTime: 1 day]</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Standard Shipping and Express Shipping Delivery is our default shipping option: fast and reliable delivery via courier, depending on the destination.</p>
        <p>Overnight Shipping Delivery uses the fastest possible delivery method: UPS Express, FedEx Express, DHL Express, or Chronopost Express.</p>
      </>

  },
  {
    question: 'When will my order be dispatched?',
    answer: (
      <>

          <li>An order placed Friday, 9AM GMT+1 will be dispatched the same day.</li>
          <li>An order placed on Friday, 6PM GMT+1 will be dispatched Saturday.</li>
        </ul>

  {
    question: 'Is my delivery protected?',
    answer: <p>All Hackshop shipments are insured with the carrier.</p>,
  },
  {
    question: 'My order has missing / incorrect products.',
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>Please contact customer support immediately. For your protection, all orders are photographed before leaving the warehouse. In the case of missing or incorrect products, we will compare a photograph of products received vs. products sent. If the warehouse photo confirms the missing or incorrect product, we will immediately replace or refund the error.</p>
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: 'My parcel was opened / damaged.',
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>Do not accept a shipment that is damaged or opened. Hackshop packages are securely prepared in double-wall boxes with an anti-tear shipping satchel. Accidental opening of packages is not possible. If your package is damaged or opened, refuse the parcel.</p>
        <p>If you accept a parcel that has been damaged or opened in transit, Hackshop is unable to provide any recourse.</p>
